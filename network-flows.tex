\subsection{Maximum Flow}
Greatest rate of transportation from source to sink, assuming G is connected ($|E| \geq |V|-1$).\\
Value of flow is sum of flow leaving the source.
$$\frac{x}{y}=\frac{f(u,v)}{c(u,v)}$$

\subsubsection{Preserving Skew Symmetry}
$$f(E,C)=5 \text{ then } f(C,E)=-5$$

\subsection{Ford-Fulkerson Method}
Runtime: $O(V\cdot E^2)$
\begin{itemize}
    \item Initially: $f(u,v) \forall u,v \in V$
    \item Iteration: increase flow by finding augmenting path
    \item Termination: no augmenting path can be found
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Residual Networks}
$c_f(u,v)=$ residual capacity $c(u,v)-f(u,v)$\\
For negative flow: $c_f \geq c$

\subsubsection{Augmenting Path}
The largest amount of flow that can be added is the smallest amount of residual capacity in the path.

\subsection{Cut of Flow Networks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A cut is the separation of vertices into two sets: $S,T$.
    \item $f(S,T)$ is the flow across the cut (add up $S\rightarrow T$ flows, take away $S(T,S)$ flows)
    \item $c(S,T)$ is the capacity of the cut
    \item The flow of any cut $ =|f|$
    \item The flow of any G is upper-bounded by capacity of any cut
\end{itemize}
