\begin{itemize}
    \item Inifinite tape
    \item Content unbounded but finite
    \item First blank symbol marks end of tape
    \item Finite state control program to move head
    \item $\Sigma$ alphabet doesn't contain the blank symbol $\sqcup$
    \item $\Gamma$ tape alphabet does though
    \item r.e = Turing recognisable
    \item recursive = Turing decidable
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Turing Recognisable}
Language, $L$, is turing recognisable if there exists a TM that recognises it.

\subsection{Turing Decidable}
If there is a TM which accepts for every $w\in L$ and rejects for every $w \notin L$.\\
If a TM decides L it always halts.\\
A language $L$ is TD iff both $L$ and $\bar{L}$ are TR.

\subsection{Theorems}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Every multitape TM has an equivalent single tape TM.
    \item Every non deterministic TM has an equivalent single tape TM.
    \item \begin{itemize}
        \item BFS on all paths
        \item Accepts on if accepting is found
        \item DFS would not work (would get stuck on non halting path)
        \item Use multitape TM to implement BFS
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Enumerators}
Outputs a list of all words in L.\\
Language is only turing recognisable if some enumerator enumerates it.

\subsection{Universal Turing Machine}
Every TM, $M$,  can be encoded as a word over a finite alphabet. $<M>$ denotes the encoding of $M$. A TM, $U$, takes a two part input, the encoding of the TM and the word $w$, and simulates $U$ on $w$.

\subsection{The Halting Problem}
Does a (universal) TM terminate on $w$?\\
IS turing recognisable.\\
IS NOT turing decidable.
