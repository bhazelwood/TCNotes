Linear Bounded Automaton (LBA) is a non-deterministic single-tape TM which can only use the part of the tape which has initially been written to.\\
Language is context sensitive if some LBA recognises it.

\subsection{Examples of Context Sensitive Languages}
$$\{a^nb^nc^n\}$$
$$\{ww|w\in \{0,1\}^*\}$$
