Context free languages are more powerful than regular languages.\\
E.g. $\{0^n1^n\}$ is context free not regular.\\
They can be defined using context-free grammars (CFGs) or push down automata (PDAs). A language is context-free iff some PDA recognises it.
\subsection{PDAs}
Is defined as an NFA with a stack.
\begin{itemize}
\item The stack can hold an unlimited number of symbols supporting the usual operations
\item $\Sigma$ is the input alphabet
\item $\Gamma$ is the stack alphabet
\end{itemize}

\subsection{CFGs}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Variables/non-terminals are in CAPS: e.g.\ A, B, C
    \item Terminals are letters of the alphabet
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Chomsky Normal Form}
If every rule is of the form: $A\Rightarrow BC$, $A\Rightarrow a$ ($S\Rightarrow \varepsilon$ is also allowed).\\
Every CFG is equivalent to one in Chomsky Normal Form.

\subsection{Pumping Lemma for CFL}
For every CFL, there is an integer $p$, so that every $w$ in $L$ of length at least $p$ can be divided into 5 parts: $w=uvxyz$ such that:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $uv^ixy^iz\in L \forall i$ (in particular $uxz\in L$)
    \item $vy$ is non empty
    \item $|vxy| \leq |p|$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Examples}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\{a^nb^nc^n\}$ is not
    \item $\{ww|w\in {0,1}^*\}$ is not
    \item $\{ww^R|w\in{0,1}^*\}$ IS
\end{itemize}
