\begin{itemize}
    \item Directed cycle is positive if sum of weights is positive
    \item Directed cycle is negative if sum of weights is negative
    \item Shortest paths contain neither of the above
    \item Dijkstra's algorithm solves the single-source shortest paths problem
    \item Generalization of BFS (where weights aren't all 1)
    \item Outputs two arrays: $d, \pi$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $d$: distance between source and vertex
        \item $\pi$: is the predecessor to the vertex
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Relaxation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Assume every weight is positive
    \item $d(v)$ is always an estimate for $\delta(s,v)$
    \item Initially $d(v)=\infty$, then always $d(v)\geq \delta(s,v)$
    \item Termination: $d(v)=\delta(s,v)$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Process}
Test if $s\rightarrow v$ can be improved by going through $u$. If so update $d(v)$ and $\pi(v)$.

\subsubsection{Running time}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Initialisation takes $O(V)$
    \item Finding minimum $d$ takes $O(V)$ done $|V|$ times.
    \item Relaxation takes $O(E)$
    \item Therefore: $O(V^2+E)=O(V^2)$
    \item Can be improved: $O(V\log{}V+E)$ with faster $d$ selection
\end{itemize}
