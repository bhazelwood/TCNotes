\begin{itemize}
    \item Yes/No answer
    \item Every optimisation problem has a decision counterpart
    \item Intractable means not solved easily
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Time Complexity}
Number of steps it takes a TM to compute

\subsubsection{Space Complexity}
Number of distinct tape cells visited

\subsubsection{Eulerian Circuit}
Cycle going through each edge once

\subsubsection{Hamiltonian Cycle}
Cycle going through each vertex once

\subsubsection{Independant Set}
At least $k$ vertices not connected by an edge

\subsubsection{Vertex Cover}
A set of most $k$ vertices covering all edges

\subsubsection{Clique}
Set of at least $k$ vertices that are adjacent

\subsubsection{Set Cover}
At most $k$ sets which union is equal to a main set.

\subsubsection{Equivalence}
\begin{itemize}
    \item IS of $k$ = VC of $n-k$
    \item Clique is equivalent to IS of the complement of the graph
    \item Set cover = vertex cover
\end{itemize}
